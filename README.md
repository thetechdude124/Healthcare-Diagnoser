# ðŸ©ºCreating an AI to Accurately and Effectively Diagnose Symptoms
A project I'm currently working on that intakes different symptoms and provides a diagnosis. The model currently has 92% accuracy - check out a demo in the webapp folder! 

For more information, check out this article I wrote detailing EXACTLY how this works - and, a presentation I hosted for this very project:

Engineering an AI-based bot for reliable medical diagnosis given a set of symptoms for those without access to doctors

Trained an MLP on ~4500 records of symptoms and diseases, with a validation accuracy of 92%.

Visualized and performed a prediction distribution analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Spearheaded user ease-of-use by building an interactive GUI + deploying the App on Heroku!

Hosted a workshop detailing this project to a group of 20+ professionals and those attempting to learn more about the field.
