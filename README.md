# ü©∫Creating an AI to Accurately and Effectively Diagnose Symptoms

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65571552/153685011-5d100e3f-7f67-49e6-a7b0-1c2f67e8ce41.png)

A project I worked on that took different symptoms and provided a diagnosis. The model currently has 92% accuracy and is deployed to Heroku!

Engineering an **AI-based algorithm for reliable medical diagnosis** given a set of symptoms for those without access to doctors.

**Trained an MLP on ~4500** records of symptoms and diseases, with a validation **accuracy of 92%.**

Visualized and performed a **prediction distribution analysis** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Spearheaded user ease-of-use by **building an interactive GUI + deploying the App on Heroku!**

Hosted a **workshop detailing this project to a group of 20+ professionals** and those attempting to learn more about the field.

For more information, check out this article I wrote detailing EXACTLY how this works - and, a presentation I hosted for this very project:
